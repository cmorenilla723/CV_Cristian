** PROJECT ANALYSIS****
***********************

   ***********************
   **Target User Profile**
   ***********************
    The final user of this web page would be mainly an ETT or company looking for people,
    specifically people for jobs in factories for the summer. Since I have focused it on my own
    CV that I use every summer to look for work in different factories or other companies.
    It is also useful for people who want to make a web page about their CV and want to see how I have made mine
    using it either as a guide for your own or if you need to use mine and adapt it to your own web page.

   ****************************
   **Information Architecture**
   ****************************
   I have used flex for this practice and divided the different sections by grid to make it more comfortable.
    In the HTML I have divided, as I have already mentioned, the sections, on the one hand there are the "section class="right-section"
    or also "section class="experience" that a mark that we are in the section on the right (about me, experience, etc) and the other is within the right-section and specifically in "experience"
    in this way it is much more understandable in the CSS that has to be modified and what not.


   ***************************
   *******Visual Design*******
   ***************************
    This part has been the most difficult of all since I am very good at Visual Design.
    So I have looked at different color palettes or simply CV colors that I have been looking at and I have chosen the ones that I think would be the best at the end.
    For the typography I used Roboto sans-serif, which is very similar to the one I have on my own CV.
    For the Layout of the page I have chosen to make it similar to a WEB page that I did in middle grade 3 and a half years ago. which is simply a display flex
    of a container in the middle of the screen and the background outside the container of some color.
